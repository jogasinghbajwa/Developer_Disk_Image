# Developer Disk Image
Xcode Developer Disk Image for iOS 9.0 and Above.

Extracted from Version 12.0 beta 2 (12A6163b).

Support latest version of iOS 14.0 beta 2 (18A5319i)

# Why We need disk images?
When your apple device got upgraded to new OS, the current XCode version you have used doesn't have the appropriate disk image for that OS version. This prevents you to push the build to the device.

# Where to put the new disk images?
iOS: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport
tvOS: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppletvOS.platform/DeviceSupport
watchOS: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/WatchOS.platform/DeviceSupport
